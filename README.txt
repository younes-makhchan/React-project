intall the dependencies for both client side(client folder) and server side(server folder)
by command npm install

then go to the server folder and add your CONNECTION_URL and YOUR PORT

then run command npm start in terminal for both folders (you would need two terminals )

and you are ready to go .

HINT: before entering those command make sure you are in that directory in the terminal
